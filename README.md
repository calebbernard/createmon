# createmon

Intending to migrate to Python / pygame for the following reasons:
1. Locking to a turn-based model is wrong for a pokemon-style game, some aspects like NPC-movement or those pads that push you around should happen independently of player input.
2. Talking to potential players, having the ability to add art for created pokemon would be an important feature, which isn't feasible in a console game.
